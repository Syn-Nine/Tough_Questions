# Tough_Questions
This is a list of tough questions I've been asked / have asked in my industry work. These are questions that I keep in my notebook to routinely ask myself and ask others (with empathy) in the pursuit of creating a better product or improving a process.

I was inspired by @troyhunt's ["Hack Your Career"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MUhcgXBj_A) talk to start documenting my work publicly. Comments, criticism, and pull requests are welcome.
